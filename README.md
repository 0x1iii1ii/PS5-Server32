# PS5-Server32
 
This is a project designed for the <a href=https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s2>ESP32-S2</a>, <a href=https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3>ESP32-S3</a> boards to provide a wifi http(s) server, dns server.

<br>

it is for the <a href=https://github.com/Cryptogenic/PS5-IPV6-Kernel-Exploit>PS5 3.xx / 4.xx Kernel Exploit</a>

using this fork of the exploit <a href=https://github.com/idlesauce/PS5-Exploit-Host>PS5 3.xx / 4.xx Kernel Exploit</a>


### this project does not work with the original esp32 board, if you have that board then use the <a href=https://github.com/stooged/PS5-Server32/tree/main/Archived_PS5_Server32>archived version</a>

if you wish to use a sd card with your board then also use the archived version.

if you have the LilyGo T-Dongle-S3 use the <a href=https://github.com/stooged/PS5-Dongle>PS5-Dongle version</a>


<br>


## Libraries

the project is built using <b><a href=https://github.com/stooged/esp32_https_server>ESP32 HTTPS Server</a>, <a href=https://github.com/adafruit/SdFat>SdFat - Adafruit Fork</a> and <a href=https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SPIFlash>Adafruit_SPIFlash</a></b> so you need to add these libraries to arduino.

<br>

they can be installed using the <a href=https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries/>library manager</a>

<img src=https://github.com/stooged/PS5-Server32/blob/main/images/fat.jpg><br>

<br>

install or update the ESP32 core by adding this url to the <a href=https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/cores>Additional Boards Manager URLs</a> section in the arduino "<b>Preferences</b>".

` https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json `

then goto the "<b>Boards Manager</b> and install or update the "<b>esp32</b>" core.

<br>

if you have problems with the board being identified/found in windows then you might need to install the <a href=https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers>USB to UART Bridge</a> drivers.

<br>


## Uploading to board

installation is simple you just use the arduino ide to flash the sketch/firmware to the esp32 board.<br>
make sure you select a <b>FAT</b> or <b>FATFS</b> partition in the board settings.<br>

plug the esp into your computer and it will show up as a usb flash drive and you can then add the <a href=https://github.com/stooged/PS5-Server32/tree/main/files>files</a> to the root of the drive.<br>

<img src=https://github.com/stooged/PS5-Server32/blob/main/images/files.jpg><br>

to save space you can use the <a href=https://github.com/stooged/PS5-Server32/tree/main/gzip>gzip script</a> to compress all of the files.

## Cases

i have created some basic printable cases for the following boards.<br>
these cases can be printed in PLA without supports.

if you wish to edit the cases you can import the `.stl` files into <a href=https://www.tinkercad.com/>Tinkercad<a/> and edit them to suit your needs.
