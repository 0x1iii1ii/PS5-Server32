# Partitions
 
custom partitions for this project to get the most storage space out of the esp32 board.<br>

<br><br>

to use these partitions you need to know the flash size of your board and select that in Tools > Flash Size<br><br>

<br><br>

then make sure you select the Huge APP partition in Tools > Partition Scheme<br><br>

<br><br>

once that is done you need to choose the <b>partitions.csv</b> that matches your boards flash size in the <a href=https://github.com/stooged/PS5-Server32/tree/main/partitions>partitions</a>folder and copy it to the sketch folder.<br><br>
